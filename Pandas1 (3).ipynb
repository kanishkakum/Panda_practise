       "  'body': 'Closes #46218\\r\\n\\r\\nxref https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/46218#issuecomment-1073362376 for the actual reason that causes `cut` to fail: inside the implementation, we convert the actual timestamp data to floats (to pass to the underlying algorithm), but then when passing those values to `IntervalIndex.get_indexer`, those numeric values no longer \"match\" with the datetime64 interval dtype. And in theory, `get_indexer` should then fail (return -1 for not finding the target values), but until https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/42227 this actually happily worked (and therefore also let `cut` with datetime64 interval bins work).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR doesn\\'t solve the root cause (we should change the logic inside `cut` so that we don\\'t create this mismatch in values vs bins), but it is a short-term fix of the regression. It basically reverts the (unintended, I think) behaviour change introduced by https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/42227, but without actually reverting that PR (I am keeping the refactor introducing `_should_partial_index` of that PR, but I am only changing `_should_partial_index` itself a little bit to match better with what happened before in practice). \\r\\n\\r\\nI will open a separate issue about the issue in `cut` and that we should make `IntervalIndex.from_indexer` more strict.

       "  'body': 'Originally reported in GeoPandas: https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/2493\\r\\n\\r\\nThis worked in pandas 1.3.5, was then originally \"broken\" by https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/43043 (as an unintended side effect of some of the (proper) changes in that PR) somewhere between 1.3 and 1.4.0 but got fixed again before the final 1.4.0 because of subsequent refactoring in the internal concat code. Some of those refactors were then reverted in 1.4.3 for being able to revert the all-NA change (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/47372), surfacing the \"bug\" again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not necessarily strictly a \"bug\" in pandas (I also don\\'t know if we make any guarantees about preserving array objects, let alone its attributes), but I think this is a decent change nevertheless. \\r\\nCurrently, when concatting/merging a column with all-NA data, we create the \"empty\" (all-NA) array for the result from scratch. While if there is no dtype change, and so the original column already has the correct dtype, we can actually just reindex that array instead of creating a new all-NA array. For builtin dtypes that might not matter much, but for custom ExtensionArrays that avoids going through some complex code to create this new all-NA array:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/fc68a9a290fc314c090e037597138c74fa23ee6d/pandas/core/internals/concat.py#L479-L488\\r\\n\\r\\nIn GeoPandas, our ExtensionArray holds some optional attribute information (eg the coordinate reference system, a spatial index, ..) that is not part of the dtype. And so in that case, reindexing the original array lets geopandas preserve that information (if appropriate), while if creating an empty array from scratch with the code above, this information is definitely lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the two-line actual code change, this PR adds a new, minimal test ExtensionArray that exhibits this behaviour of having an attribute, to be able to test this without dependency on GeoPandas.',\n",

How the error is reported should not affect whether or not a parsing error occurs. Initially it appears that experiment 1 should return an error (as experiment 3 does) because the second date string does not match the format established by the first string.  However, there is a fallback mechanism that is supposed to try parsing again without the effect of the `infer_datetime_format` flag. So in fact, experiment 3 should succeed in parsing the date as experiment 1 does.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe problem is that the fallback mechanism only works when `errors=raise`. This bug fix applies the same logic when `errors=coerce` so that the fallback parsing will take place regardless of how errors are reported.\\r\\n',\n",
